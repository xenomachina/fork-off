Fork Off! "The Bird in a Tree" Graphic
==

This is a little graphic [I drew up and initally posted on
Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/2jvupv/unix_greybeards_threaten_debian_fork_over_systemd/clfydqx)
in a discussion where another user,
[Epistaxis](http://www.reddit.com/user/Epistaxis), used the phrase "fork off"
as a response for people who "threaten" that they'll fork an open source
project. For some reason the idea of a git commit graph giving someone "the
bird" immediately popped into my mind.

The graphic proved to be popular, and in the spirit of its message, making it
open source seemed the way to go. So here we are.

If your browser supported SVG you'd see the graphic here.
